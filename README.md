# Fourier-Analysis-MPI

## Fourier Analysis
Fourier analysis is a mathematical technique used to decompose a complex signal or function into simpler components, revealing the frequency content of the original signal. Fourier analysis is widely used in signal processing to analyze and filter signals. It helps in understanding the frequency components present in a signal.

## Message Passing Interface (MPI)
A standardized and portable message-passing system designed for parallel computing. It allows processes in a parallel system to communicate with each other by exchanging messages. MPI is commonly used in high-performance computing environments to enable efficient communication and coordination among multiple processors. MPI is widely used in scientific and engineering applications where parallel processing is essential for handling large datasets and complex simulations.
